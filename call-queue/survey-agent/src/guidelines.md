# Treat everyone with respect

## Respect isn’t always about what you say—it’s also about how you act

We believe that everyone should feel supported and welcomed when interacting with others in the LiveRide community. That’s why we’ve created standards and policies on threatening and rude behavior, post-trip contact, physical contact, discrimination, sexual assault and misconduct, and property damage.

The actions you take while using the LiveRide Marketplace Platform can have a big impact on the safety and comfort of others. Courtesy matters. For example, always try to be on time for your ride or to pick up your delivery. It’s also common courtesy not to shout, swear, or slam doors. And by tidying up after yourself—whether it’s taking your trash home or cleaning up a spilled drink—you’ll help ensure that everyone has a pleasant ride.

Remember that when you interact with others in the LiveRide community, you may meet people who may look different from you, think differently than you, or come from different backgrounds. Please respect those differences.


## Threatening and rude behavior

Aggressive, confrontational, and harassing behavior is not allowed. Don’t use language or make gestures that could be disrespectful, discriminatory, threatening, or inappropriate.

If you are the recipient of or witness to any threatening or rude behavior, you can report the situation to LiveRide. We’ll address any report in accordance with our policies.

## Post-trip contact

Contact should end when the trip or delivery is complete, unless it’s to return a lost item. Unwanted contact (where there is no mutual consent) can be seen as harassment and includes, for example, texting, calling, visiting, contacting on social media, or trying to visit someone in person after a trip or delivery has been completed.

### Tips for drivers and delivery people

You should immediately alert LiveRide if a customer, rider, or merchant contacts you for any reason other than your current trip or delivery, or to return a lost item.

### Tips for riders and LiveRide Eats users

Alert LiveRide immediately if a driver or delivery person contacts you for any reason other than your current trip or delivery, or to return a lost item.

## Physical contact

Don’t touch strangers or anyone you just met while using any of LiveRide’s apps. Limited exceptions are permitted for people needing or requesting physical assistance (for example, riders using LiveRide Assist who may need help getting into and out of the vehicle). Hurting or intending to hurt anyone is never allowed.

## Discrimination

You should always feel safe and welcome. That’s why we don’t tolerate racist or discriminatory conduct or behavior.

Do not discriminate against someone or act in a disparaging manner toward someone based on traits such as their age, skin color, disability, gender identity, marital status, pregnancy, national origin, race, ethnicity, religion, sex, sexual orientation, language, geographical location, or any other characteristic protected under relevant law. For example, it is unacceptable to rate another person based on any protected trait.

## LiveRide takes reports of discriminatory behavior very seriously

If you are subject to discrimination or witness discriminatory behavior, you can report the incident to LiveRide by choosing **Help** in the LiveRide or LiveRide Eats app or visiting [help.LiveRide.com](http://help.LiveRide.com) so that our Support team can follow up and take the appropriate action. Call 911 for immediate assistance if you feel like your safety is in danger.

Any users found to have engaged in discriminatory behavior or used discriminatory language may lose access to the LiveRide platform.

## Sexual assault and misconduct

We all value our personal space and privacy. It’s OK to chat with other people while remaining respectful. But please don’t comment on someone’s appearance or ask whether they are single. Sexual assault and sexual misconduct of any kind is prohibited. Sexual assault and misconduct refers to sexual contact or behavior without explicit consent of the other person.

Personal space and privacy should be respected. LiveRide has a no-sex rule regardless of whether you know the person or they give you their consent.

## Property damage

Damaging property is never allowed. Some examples include damaging the car or other mode of transportation requested through the LiveRide platform, breaking or vandalizing a phone or tablet, intentionally spilling food or drink, smoking in a car, damaging a merchant’s premises, or vomiting due to excessive alcohol consumption or otherwise. If you damage property, you’re responsible for the cost of cleaning and repair fees, outside of normal wear and tear. Intentional damage may result in account deactivation.
